# hpc - High Performance Computing

This repository contains templates and example code used for cluster computing and other high performance computing applications. The code is nested in two levels reflecting two different HPC clusters and particularly their scheduler and management software configurations. The software and clusters are:

  - The Open Grid Scheduler on [Maxwell](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/hpc.php) at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK

  - The `Torque/Moab` resource manager/scheduler (torque is an open source fork of [OpenPBS](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/openpbs/)) on [Hopper](https://hpcportal.auburn.edu/hpc/index.php) at Auburn University, AL, USA

## R Statistical Software on the HPC
Much of the code focuses on parallel computing in conjunction with the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) statistical program.
